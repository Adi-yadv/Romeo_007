# Six-Wheeled Rover (Modified JPL Open-Source Rover)

This repository contains the complete design, fabrication files, and electronics documentation for our **custom six-wheeled rover**, inspired by **NASA JPL’s Open-Source Rover**.  
We have added multiple enhancements such as a **rear tail extension** for drone landing and a **front-mounted robotic arm** for multiple purpose tasks.

## Project Overview

Our rover is designed as a robust, all-terrain test platform for robotics and embedded systems.  
It features:

- 6-wheel rocker-bogie suspension  
- Differential bar for better obstacle handling  
- Rear tail for landing a drone 
- Front robotic arm mount   
- 3D-printed joints + machined hybrid structure  
- Arduino/RPi compatible electronics layout  
- Modular chassis allowing quick modifications
